Here are some notes I have taken during my PhD sutdy and it is useful for me to review what I have studied.

## Change Measure and Risk Neutral 
This note is mainly realted to the measure change in stochastic process and its famous application risk neutral measure in financial mathematics.

## Scale Function and Speed Measure
This note concentrates on the scale function and speed measure, which helps us to transform one dimensional diffusion process to a standard Brownian motion, and they are widely used in exiting probelms.

## Measure Theory and Ergodic Theory
This note is based on the MSc Course [MATH61021](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/list/12519/msc-pure-mathematics/course-details/MATH61021#course-unit-details) taught by [Dr Donald Robertson](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/donald.robertson/default.htm). I study this course and take this note based on the Lecture material. It is a compreshensive course about measure theory and ergodic theory.
