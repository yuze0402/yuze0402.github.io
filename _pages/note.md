Here are some notes I have taken during my PhD sutdy and it is useful for me to review what I have studied.

## Change Measure and Risk Neutral 
This note is mainly realted to the measure change in stochastic process and its famous application risk neutral measure in financial mathematics.

## Local Time
This note focuses on the concept of local time and its application on It√¥'s formula, which is widely used in solving the optimal stopping problem.

## Optimal Stopping Problems
This note documents some facts and solutions to the optimal stopping problem in discrete and continuous time framework.

## Scale Function and Speed Measure
This note concentrates on the scale function and speed measure, which helps us to transform one dimensional diffusion process to a standard Brownian motion, and they are widely used in exiting probelms.
