I am a first year PhD student in the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) jointly supervised by [Dr Jos√© Pedraza Ramirez](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/jose-pedraza-ramirez) and [Dr Kees van Schaik](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/kees.vanschaik/). My current research focus on the areas of financial mathematics such as time-inconsistent problems, asset pricing, and optimal stopping problems.
